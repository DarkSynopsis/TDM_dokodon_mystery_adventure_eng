English translated images/scripts for the 3DS game "Taiko Drum Master: Dokodon! Mystery Adventure!"

**Download the release and copy it to the root of your SD card for use with Luma 7.0's LayeredFS feature**

You will need to have "Game Patching" set to enabled in Luma's config settings first!

*As of Luma 7.0.3, the LayeredFS function works perfectly with this game's original version available from the eShop/freeShop, or as a cartridge. It also works with the merged 1.0+1.1 CIA floating around on the internet.

More details for other patching methods coming soon. Most big kids should be able to figure out how to merge the files on their own though! ;p
