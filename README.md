English translated images/scripts for the 3DS game "Taiko Drum Master: Dokodon! Mystery Adventure!"

**Copy the "_data" folder to "SD:/Luma/titles/0004000000190E00/romfs" for use with Luma 7.0's LayeredFS feature**
You will need to have "Game Patching" set to enabled in Luma's config settings first!

*As of Luma 7.0.3, the LayeredFS function works perfectly with this game's original version available from the eShop/freeShop, or as a cartridge. It also works with the merged 1.0+1.1 CIA floating around on the internet.
